## Health Insurance Premium Prediction App

### Overview

The **Health Insurance Premium Prediction App** is a machine learning application that predicts health insurance premiums based on various features such as age, income, and medical history. The app uses a combination of Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, and XGBoost models to provide accurate predictions. The front end is developed using **Streamlit**.

### Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleans and prepares the data by handling missing values, outliers, and categorical features.
- **Model Training:** Trains Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, and XGBoost models.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Uses RandomizedSearchCV for optimizing the XGBoost model.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluates models using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
- **Prediction:** Provides predictions based on user input through the Streamlit interface.
